Welcome to A Whisper in Steel! 

**Background**
While I had the idea for this game for a while, I only got to actually making it for Technica 2024. Truth be told, I was inspired by watching way too many Game Theorists
videos during high school.

**Engine**
This game was created using the Twine engine and using the Sugarcube format.
